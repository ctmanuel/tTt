Rules:

-2 Player (room for more players?)

-Board starts of in a 3x3 grid
When approximately 1/2 of the board area is covered in player moves, the board increases by one row on each side
(i.e 3x3 -> 5x5 -> 7x7 -> 9x9)

-Players need to make 3 sets of 3-in-a-row moves to be considered a winner
This includes diagonals, horizontals, and verticals

-Once a player gets 3-in-a-row, that set is "locked"

-New 3-in-a-row sets cannot be attached to locked sets

-Locked sets cannot be affected by item affects (With exceptions. Subject to change)

-A player is allowed to have up to 2 items in their possession. 
At the beginning of each turn a player has the option to random an item. An item would be chosen at random and the player 
can put the item in their possession. If a player already has 2 items, the player can discard/replace one of the items.

-A player is allowed to either place a move or an item during their turn. Placing a move or an item on the board will end
the players turn, the player isn't allowed to do both during the same turn. 


Items:

Items are randomly selected for the players. Some items have a higher probability of being chosen than others, as the 
others are clearly better.

-bomb: destroys any non-locked moves within a 1 space radius

-super bomb: destroys any non-locked moves within a 2 space radius 

-teleporter: Moves any non-locked move to a location of the players chosing. If the chosen space is occupied, 
the moves switch spaces.

-Silence: Prevents player's opponents from using any items during their turn

-Turret: Place on an empty space. Destroys any new opponent moves within a 1 space radius of the turret. Lasts until
the beginning of the players next turn. 

-Curse: Place a curse on an empty or occupied space. At the end of the players next turn, if there is a move on the space
it will be destroyed. Moves that are made into locked sets with a curse on them can still trigger the winning condition,
but if it is not the 3rd locked set of the player, it will be destroyed and the locked set becomes unlocked. Cannot be
placed on a locked set.

-Air strike: Destroys all non-locked moves in a column or row of the players choosing 

-Nuke (OP?): Destroys all non-locked moves on the board

-Gem of true sight (dota reference cuz names are hard):reveals the opponents items until the beginning the the players
next turn.

-Force Staff (dota reference cuz names are hard): forces an opponent to use one of their items during their turn.

-Move Obligation: forces an opponent to place a move on the board durning their turn. 

-Item lock: prevents player's opponent from replacing their items during their turn. Items can still be used.

-Swap: All of the players non-locked moves are swapped with their opponents non-locked moves. 

-Randomize: All of the non-locked moves on the board are randomly rearranged on the board. Moves that are randomly
rearranged into 3-in-a-row sets count and are locked. 

-Board Grow: Forces the board to grow by 1 row on each size.

-Board Shrink: Forces the board to shrink by 1 row on each side. All moves within the border of the board are destroyed,
including locked sets. If the board growing condition is met at the beginning of the opponents turn, the board will grow 
out again by 1 on each side.
